- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sefont 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in in the fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Language Models (LLM). I love exploring the endless possibilities that these domains offer and constantly strive to expand my knowledge and skills in these areas.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to evolve AGIs. Transformers and attention mechanisms in language models. Reinforcement Learning algorithms and their applications. Ethics and responsible AI development.
